# Mangrove Health Prediction through Neuro-Fuzzy Inference #

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  ##

This project presents an adaptive system built with Neuro-Fuzzy Inference to identify mangrove species and assess their health despite challenges such as spectral blending, changing environmental conditions, and limited labeled data.

The system integrates neural networks for pattern recognition and fuzzy logic for handling uncertainty. It classifies mangroves into three health clusters: Good, Moderate, and Poor, with an accuracy of 95.8%. The model leverages hyperspectral and multispectral data to extract key vegetation indices and chlorophyll absorption metrics for precise classification.

ðŸŒ± Features

âœ… Species Identification: Classifies Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia officinalis, and Sonneratia alba

âœ… Health Categorization: Classifies leaves as Good, Moderate, or Poor health

âœ… Feature Extraction: Uses Gabor filters, GR statistics, CAI measurement, hue phase, and fractal patterns

âœ… Neuro-Fuzzy System: Combines fuzzy logic with neural networks for adaptive decision-making

âœ… Dimensionality Reduction: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize features
